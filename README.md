# Image-Augmentation-using-TensorFlow-2.0

A deep learning model generally works efficiently when it is provided with a huge amount of data for training. But gathering such a vast data has its own challenges like every time collecting so much of data to feed the deep learning model is difficult because it comes with a financial cost. On the other hand, with a lack of good amount of data the model will not understand trends and patterns in the data and our model will not perform well. So to address issue like this without spending days manually collecting the data, we may use Image Augmentation techniques.

### What is Image Augmentation?

Image augmentation was basically created to help deep learning models get more accuracy. Image augmentation can be said as a technical approach of adjusting the existing data in order to create more data from the existing data for training the model for more accuracy. Simply it expands the existing data.

In this tutorial,Â  we will learn how to apply various image augmentation techniques with TensorFlow 2.0. Some Transformation techniques are as follows :

* Random flipping to left-right.
* Randomly changes in contrast, brightness, saturation and hue
* Distortion and cropping of images.
